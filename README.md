# bs-checker

Simple program to check the version of Bootstrap that's being used on
a list of web sites.

Just pass it a file containing the URLs of a list of web sites, and it
will try to work out what version of Bootstrap they are all using.

You'll get the output as JSON. In this repo, we go on to load that JSON
into an HTML page.
